# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. This means each training example includes input features (independent variables) and a known output (dependent variable). The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so it can predict outcomes for new, unseen data.

Supervised learning problems are broadly categorized into:

---

## 📈 Regression
Regression algorithms are used when the output variable is continuous and numeric. They predict values such as prices, temperatures, or probabilities.

Example algorithms:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Multiple Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Elastic Net Regression**

## 🏷️ Classification
Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical. The goal is to assign input data to one of several predefined classes or categories.

Example algorithms:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes**
