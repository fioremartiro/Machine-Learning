# Regression Algorithms in Supervised Learning

Regression algorithms are used in supervised learning to model the relationship between input variables (independent variables) and a continuous output variable (dependent variable). These algorithms predict numeric values based on patterns found in the data. Below are some commonly used regression algorithms:

## 1. Linear Regression
Linear regression is the simplest type of regression algorithm used in machine learning. It models the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable using a linear function.

## 2. Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a type of regression algorithm used for classification problems. It models the probability of a binary outcome based on the independent variables.

## 3. Multiple Regression
Multiple regression is an extension of linear regression that allows us to model the relationship between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable.

## 4. Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression is a type of regression algorithm that models the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable using a polynomial function.

## 5. Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression is a type of regression algorithm used to solve the problem of multicollinearity in multiple regression. It adds a regularization term to the cost function to avoid overfitting.

## 6. Lasso Regression
Lasso regression is another type of regression algorithm used to solve the problem of multicollinearity in multiple regression. It uses a different type of regularization term than Ridge Regression.

## 7. Elastic Net Regression
Elastic Net Regression is a combination of Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. It uses both types of regularization terms to solve the problem of multicollinearity.
