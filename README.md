# Machine Learning

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to sharing machine learning projects, tutorials, and step-by-step exercises. Here you’ll find a growing collection of examples and real-world projects, organized by topic and technique.

## What you’ll find here

- **Health Projects:** Real-world machine learning projects focused on healthcare data and applications.
- **Regression-Examples:** Step-by-step exercises demonstrating different regression techniques (e.g., linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, etc.).
- **Classification-Examples:** Exercises and tutorials on various classification methods (e.g., logistic regression, LDA, SGD classifier, and more).
- **DeepLearning-Examples:** Examples and mini-projects using deep learning techniques.
- **And more:** I’ll be adding new folders and content over time, including clustering, data preprocessing, and other machine learning topics.

## Stay tuned!

I’m actively working on uploading new content. If you have suggestions or requests, feel free to open an issue or reach out to me on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/fiorellamartiro.
